## General Information
Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. This project is about Skin Cancer or Melanoma detection that is infered from various pictures of skin diseases. In order to do so, we need to build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma.
Specifically, this is a solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

We processed 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases, which were formed from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC). All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
